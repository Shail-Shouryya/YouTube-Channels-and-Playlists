Whether you're about to go out, having a party or just relaxing; we aim to represent something exciting, attractive and inviting.  The name originated because a small group of friends while at college struggled to find music which had originality and didn't conform to the generic "pop" which was consistently released to the public. College Music is about new music from unheard artists and providing a platform for them to be heard by listeners like us. We firmly believe that a brand‚Äôs name, ethos, and content should all align together. For us, our name ties in perfectly.
